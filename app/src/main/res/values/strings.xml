    <string name="txtBlurb">This app provides very accurate and precise timing. The timing of each tick is precisely derived from the starting point, meaning when you tap "Start," or the most recent time you changed the tempo. Even if other apps are running (like a recorder), the timing will stay accurate. This allows you to record a track in time with this app and use it in the production of a song.</string>
