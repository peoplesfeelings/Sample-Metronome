to do
    redo filetype filter
    route audio files to corresponding decoder
    implement jlayer for mp3
        http://www.badlogicgames.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=17829
    implement flac library
    allow for decoding time when changing sample file while playing
    android:description attribute to the <service> element in your app manifest
    fix timing
    fix wonky beginning
        maybe try moving the lastTick assignment below sounds.play before the while loop in loop()

optimize timing
    dont cast value of service.interval to int
        keep value as double until after multiplied by count

check
    does lastTick need to be initialized in oncreate?
        check against default 0L in setinterval seems like a check for not initialized
    if there are no files, does loadFile and start() fail gracefully
        soundpool.load returns 0 if it fails

test
    induce lost serviceconncection and see
        if start/stop listener fails gracefully
        if service keeps running after activity is destroyed (when not playing)

about
    apache commons io
    jlayer
    justflac

maybe do
    move fileNeedsToBeLoaded to Dry

for release

replicate

audiotrack
    https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/MediaCodecInfo.html
    https://0110.be/posts/Decode_MP3s_and_other_Audio_formats_the_easy_way_on_Android
    implement check for length, since not streaming pcm into audiotrack
    how will various sample rates work with SAMPLE_RATE_UNSPECIFIED set
    does format need to be specified
    note buffer size limit for user?
    ndk and c/c++ libraries to get pcm data like libmad?
    openjdk include like this dude says? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16803343/javax-cannot-be-imported-in-my-android-app
    call release in onstop?

    main activity
        when main activity is created, it
            checks if app has run before and, if not,
                sets default settings
                launches welcome dialog
                makes directory and writes preliminary files
            creates a seviceconnection instance with listeners
                once connected,
                    activity checks services looprunning bool to set button text accordingly
                    dial is set up here because onmove and onup listeners call service's setinterval
                    edittext is set up here because the textwatcher's aftertextchanged listener calls service's setinterval
                    spinner is set up here because the spinner's setonitemclicklistener assigns the service's rate member and calls setinterval
                        also the setup method assigns the rate member the value loaded from shareprefs
                    listeners set up because start/stop button calls service methods start, stop, and setinterval
            checks if service is running, and if not, starts it
            binds to service using serviceconnection
        start/stop button
            checks if service is playing
                may be playing if it was playing when the prior instance of activity was destroyed
            calls setinterval because it may not have been called yet

    service
        started when activity starts, if not started already
        stopped in activity's ondestroy, if bound and not playing
        foreground
            started in onstart, stopped in onstop
        when service starts

                        bpm is set from fta value
                        interval is set as quotient of duration of beat over rate
                    takes a double fta because app treats dial's "full texture angle" as central store of its position / the bpm
    storage
        convenient place for static members to be shared by components but not dependent on any / complicating life cycles
