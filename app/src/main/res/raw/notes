to do
    alert dialog for if audio file doesn't meet criteria
    android:description attribute to the <service> element in your app manifest
    fix wonky beginning
    if loadFile returns false,
        button text should not change
        check for any other state that needs to be updated
    om click listener for sample screen list items
    call loadfile on ui main thread?
    reverse double negative of fileneedstobeloaded
    update documentation

    check
        the wav parsing code assumes little endian...
        if there are no files, does loadFile and start() fail gracefully
        handler.postattime works if time is missed

    test
        induce lost serviceconncection and see
            if start/stop listener fails gracefully
            if service keeps running after activity is destroyed (when not playing)

maybe do
    move fileNeedsToBeLoaded to Dry

audiotrack
    better to decode async?
    checks
        implement check for length, since not streaming pcm into audiotrack
        how will various sample rates work with SAMPLE_RATE_UNSPECIFIED set
        does format need to be specified
        note buffer size limit for user?
        call release in onstop?

    main activity
        when main activity is created, it
            checks if app has run before and, if not,
                sets default settings
                launches welcome dialog
                makes directory and writes preliminary files
            creates a seviceconnection instance with listeners
                once connected,
                    activity checks services looprunning bool to set button text accordingly
                    dial is set up here because onmove and onup listeners call service's setinterval
                    edittext is set up here because the textwatcher's aftertextchanged listener calls service's setinterval
                    spinner is set up here because the spinner's setonitemclicklistener assigns the service's rate member and calls setinterval
                        also the setup method assigns the rate member the value loaded from shareprefs
                    listeners set up because start/stop button calls service methods start, stop, and setinterval
            checks if service is running, and if not, starts it
            binds to service using serviceconnection
        start/stop button
            checks if service is playing
                may be playing if it was playing when the prior instance of activity was destroyed
            calls setinterval because it may not have been called yet
            calls service.start(), service.stop()
            changes text
    service
        started when activity starts, if not started already
        stopped in activity's ondestroy, if bound and not playing
        foreground
            started in onstart, stopped in onstop
        when service starts

                        bpm is set from fta value
                        interval is set as quotient of duration of beat over rate
                    takes a double fta because app treats dial's "full texture angle" as central store of its position / the bpm
    storage
        convenient place for static members to be shared by components but not dependent on any / complicating life cycles
